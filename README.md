# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
We helped Robin make her app that gets Mars´ data from the live website.
For the challenge, she would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Results 
After doing so this is the result of the website:
- We hace a scrape button
- A facts table
- An image
- And 4 extras images of the hemispheres of Mars.
